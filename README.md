# Why do Frontend Frameworks exist?

Frontend frameworks like React.js exist to make it easier and faster to build cool and interactive website. They probide a set of rules and tools that help developers create websites more efficiently. Here's why they're helpful.

1. **Faster Development**: They help developers write code more quickly.
2. **Modular Design**: They let developers build websites in smaller, reusable parts.
3. **Easy Updates**: They make it simple to update parts of a website without affecting the whole thing.
4. **Smart Handling**: They manage how a website looks and behaves, making it easier for developers.
5. **Ready-Made Solutions**: They come with helpful features and solutinos that save time.
6. **Big Support Community**: Many developers use these frameworks, so there's lots of help and resource available.
7. **Works EVerywhere**: They ensure that websites work well on different web browers

# What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React is a **Declarative**, **Component Based**, **State driven**, JavaScript **Library** for building user-interfaces, created by facebook.

- **Component Based**: Components are the building blocks of user-interfaces. Components are reusable.
- **Declarative**: Declarative describe how components look like and how they work using a **declarative syntax called JSX**. _Declarative_ simply means telling React what a component should look like, **based on current data/state**.

React is **abstraction** away from DOM. We never touch the DOM.

**JSX** is a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as referencing other components.

- **State-Driven**: React _reacts_ to state changes by Re-Rendering the UI

**Note**: \*React updates it's UI using **state\***

- **JavaScript Library**: React is a library because React is only the "view" layer. We need to pick multiple external libraries to build a complete application.

Note: \*Frameworks built on React are **NEXT.js** and **Remix\***

# Setting Up React Project

1. **Create React App(CRA):** _Create React App_ is a command tool that sets up a new React project with pre-configured development environment.

**Advantages**

- Quick and easy: It provides a streamlined setup without the need for manuak configuration.

- Configuration abstraction: Many configurations are abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on coding.

**Usage**

- Open a terminal and run the following command

```
    npx create-react-app your-project-name
```

- Replace "your-project-name" with the desired name for your React Project.

- Once the installation is complete, navigate into the project folder:

```
cd your-project-name
```

- Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see your new React app.

2. **Manual Setup** Manually setting up a React project involves creating the project structure and configuring the necessary tools yourself.

**Advantages**

- Full control: Allows for customised setup tailored to sepcific project requirements.
- Learning experience: Provides a deeper understanding of the underlying tools and configurations.

**Steps**

- Create a new projet folder and navigate into it

```
mkdir your-peoject-name
cd your-project-name
```

- Initialise a new Node project (creates a **'package.json'** file)

```
npm init -y
```

- install React and ReactDOM packages

```
npm install react react-dom
```

- Create an HTML file such as **'index.html'**, and set up a root element for your React app.

- Use a bundler like Webpack to bundle your JavaScript files.
- Set up Babel to transpile React code.
- Create a build script in **package.json** to run the development server or build the project.
- Start the development server or build the project based on your configuration.

Choosing between **Create React App** and **manual Setup** depends on factors like product complexity, customization needs, and the desire for a quick start versus a more hands-on learning experience. `create-react-app` is often recommended for beginners or smaller projects, while manual setup provides more flexibility for larger and customized projects.

3. **VITE**
   Vite is another tool that can be used to set up a React project, and it's gaining popularity in the React community. Vite is a fast, opinionated frontend bulild tool that aims to procide a quick and efficient development experience. Here's a brief overview of using Vite for setting up a React project.

**Installation**

- reate a new project folder and navigate into it

```
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

- initialise a new Node.js project (creates a '**package.json**' file)

```
npm init -y
```

- install Vite globally

```
npm install -g create-vite
```

**Create a React Aoo with Vite**

- Run the following command to create a new React app with Vite.

```
create-vite your-project-name --template react
```

- Navigate into the project folder

```
cd your-project-name
```

** Development**

- Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

- visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see your React app.
